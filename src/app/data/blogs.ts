      'The journey of Queens Park Band: from songwriting to live shows and recording albums.',
    body: 'Queens Park Band was born out of a shared passion for music among a group of friends during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our journey began with songwriting sessions, where we would gather to brainstorm ideas, experiment with melodies, and craft lyrics that resonated with our experiences. The creative process was both challenging and exhilarating, as we saw our ideas evolve from rough sketches into complete songs. We then took our songs to the stage, performing live shows that allowed us to connect with our audience and share our music with the world. The highlight of our journey so far has been recording a full-length album in the studio, a process that allowed us to refine our sound and produce a tangible representation of our musical vision. Currently, we are focusing on writing another full-length album and continuing to perform live shows. The process of creating music, from the initial spark of inspiration to the final product, is a deeply rewarding experience that fuels our passion for what we do.',

      'A project I used to document and archive the music scene of Victoria, BC.',
    body: "<p>In 2022, I embarked on a journey to capture and preserve the essence of the music scene in Victoria, BC, through a project I called Medium Good Media. My goal was to document and archive the vibrancy, diversity, and energy of local music events in their most authentic form.</p><p>This initiative was born out of a desire to create a tangible snapshot of our musical era, providing future generations a window into the live performances and dynamic atmosphere that define our current music scene. To achieve this, I focused on recording full-length, uncut videos of band sets. These recordings are not just videos; they are time capsules, preserving the raw, unfiltered essence of live performances for posterity.</p><p>Photography played a crucial role in this project as well. By capturing the fleeting moments of concerts and music events, I aimed to complement the video archives with still images that encapsulate the energy, emotions, and narratives unfolding on and off stage. Each photo tells a story, contributing to a broader narrative about our local music culture.</p><p>To share these moments and stories with the world, I turned to YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook. These platforms allowed me to reach a wide audience, inviting music enthusiasts, artists, and historians alike to explore and reminisce about the music scene of Victoria, BC. Through Medium Good Media, viewers can dive into the past, experiencing the ambiance and spirit of live performances as if they were there themselves, or to relive a great night.</p><p>Medium Good Media has become more than just a project; it's a growing archive and a testament to the talent, passion, and community that thrive in Victoria's music scene. As I continue to document and share these experiences, my hope is that this archive serves not only as a reflection of our time but also as an inspiration for future musicians and music lovers to keep the spirit of live music alive and thriving.</p>",

    excerpt: 'The build process of a guitar volume pedal.',
    body: "<p>When playing through my Fender Hotrod Deville amplifier, I encountered a significant issue with the volume control. The built-in linear taper potentiometer made volume adjustments feel more like sudden jumps rather than smooth transitions. This was particularly problematic for maintaining a reasonable noise level in my apartment.</p><p>In search of a solution, I realized that using a volume pedal in the amp's effects loop could offer a more gradual control over the volume, utilizing a logarithmic potentiometer. However, rather than relying on an external pedal connected by cables, I was inspired by the concept of a direct plug-in device, similar to the Lion Tamer product I found online. This led me to design my own version of a volume control pedal.</p><p>I designed the circuit which was fairly simple since it was just a couple 1/4‚Äù audio jacks soldered to a potentiometer. Using calipers, I measured the distance between the effects loop jacks and designed the pedal's body in Fusion 360 and 3D printed it in PLA using my Geeetech A20M. Assembly was straightforward, involving soldering the electronic components and securing the body with heat-set inserts.</p><p>This custom pedal has dramatically improved my playing experience. It seamlessly integrates with my amp, offering precise volume control and allowing me to play at levels suitable for any environment, from quiet home practice sessions to louder performances. The project was not only a practical solution to a frustrating problem but also a rewarding DIY endeavor that combined my interests in music and technology.</p>",
